# Project

This is a project setup to build a C project using [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
and using [unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) unit testing
framework.

TODO: command line arguments
TODO: Unit tests
TODO: Refactored code

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies which need to be installed with
your package manager before you can continue:

- [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)
- [pthreads](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/)
- [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)

## Quick Start

1. run `./setup.sh`
2. compile the project `cd build && make`
3. run the tests `./test-lab`

The program and tests will be located in the build directory. The program that
will run all your tests that you wrote in `test-lab.c` is named `test-lab`. Some
projects may also require an executable which is named `myprogram`.

If you run into problems and don't know what when wrong you should run the
`clean.sh` and start over.
