[![Test on multiple platforms](https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template/actions/workflows/test-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template/actions/workflows/test-multi-platform.yml)

# Quick Start

Install all the required dependencies for your operating system as detailed below.
Once all the dependencies are installed you can build the project with cmake.
This project has a preset file to help build the project. You can list all the
presets with `cmake --list-presets`. You can get started right away with the
Address Sanitizer build as shown below.

```bash
cmake --preset x86_x64-ASan
cmake --build --preset x86_x64-ASan
```

The following workflows are setup. Each workflow will configure build and test.
The `coverage` target only works on Linux.

```bash
- cmake --workflow --preset coverage
- cmake --workflow --preset test
```

## Operating Systems Notes

While this project is configure to download and install all the require
libraries each operating system still needs to have some tools installed to
proceed. The following sections will help you install the required dependencies
for each operating system.

## VSCode Notes

The VSCode CMake extension (2023-10-17) does not support all the features of
cmake presets that this project uses so you will need to add the following to
your settings.json file so that the extension does not complain about the
new features we are using.`"cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions": true`
